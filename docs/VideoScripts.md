## Script 1: "The Tennis Match That Changed Everything"

### Hook (0:00-0:10)
"I used to outwork everyone in the boardroom and still make it to my daughter's soccer game. Then I turned 46, and my body started saying 'no' when my mind said 'yes.'"

### The Miserable Problem (0:10-0:45)
"It started small. A twinge in my knee after my morning run. Taking two days to recover from tennis matches instead of two hours. 

But the moment that really got me? A doubles match last spring. I'm competitive—always have been. And there I was, watching my 28-year-old opponent basically run circles around me. Not because she was more skilled. I'd been playing twice as long as she'd been alive. But by the third set, my joints were on fire, my muscles were done, and I felt like I was moving through mud. 

I lost that match. But worse than that, I lost confidence in my own body."

### Failed Solutions (0:45-1:15)
"So I did what I always do—dove into research mode. 

Tried those collagen powders that taste like candy. Nothing. 

Bought the 'protein shakes for women'—which turned out to be expensive chocolate milk with maybe 12 grams of protein. 

My bathroom counter looked like a pharmacy exploded. Separate bottles for protein, collagen, multivitamins, joint support... Every morning felt like a chemistry experiment. And I still felt like I was falling apart.

The worst part? Everything was either marketed to 25-year-old influencers trying to get a bigger butt, or 70-year-olds in assisted living. Nobody was talking to women like me—still running teams, still playing sports, but suddenly fighting a body that won't cooperate."

### The Climax (1:15-1:35)
"I remember sitting in my car after pitching for three hours straight. I went to turn the steering wheel and... I couldn't. My shoulders were so stiff I literally had to use my whole body to turn.

I'm 46. Not 86.

I sat there thinking: 'Is this it? Is this what happens now? I just... accept this?'

I run a team of 30 people. I have two teenagers. Slowing down isn't even on the table."

### Unique Mechanism Introduction (1:35-2:00)
"Then at book club, my friend Sarah—she's an orthopedic surgeon and runs marathons—dropped this bomb: 'You know we lose 10-15% of our muscle every decade after 40, right?'

I didn't.

Then she said something that changed everything: 'There's one supplement that actually works for women our age. Creatine. It's been studied for 30 years. Totally safe. And it's the only thing proven to actually build and maintain muscle in perimenopausal women.'

I said, 'Then why isn't everyone taking it?'

She laughed. 'Because no one's making it for us. It's all marketed to 22-year-old gym bros.'"

### Soft Guarantee (2:00-2:15)
"That conversation led me to Nimble Daily. And look—I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's some fountain of youth. It's not magic. But they offer a 30-day guarantee because they know once you feel the difference, you're not going back."

### Why It's Better (2:15-2:45)
"Here's what makes it different: It's the ONLY protein powder with actual clinical-dose creatine. Three full grams—not a sprinkle for marketing.

Plus 26 grams of grass-fed beef protein—that's more muscle-building power than whey. And 10 grams of collagen for joints.

Basically four supplements in one scoop.

Three weeks in, I stopped groaning when I got out of bed. By week six, I was back in the game at tennis. Not playing like I'm 25—playing like a strong 46-year-old who's not going anywhere."

### Social Proof (2:45-3:00)
"I'm not the only one. There are thousands of us—executives, doctors, teachers, moms—all saying the same thing: 'Finally, something that actually works for women like us.'

Women who are back to hiking with their kids. Killing it at work. And yes, beating twenty-somethings at tennis."

### Authority Proof (3:00-3:15)
"Every batch is third-party tested. Developed by actual registered dietitians and PhDs—not influencers. And they list every single ingredient amount. No 'proprietary blends,' no BS."

### Offer (3:15-3:25)
"Right now, you can try it for 20% off. That's less than your morning latte to actually feel strong again."

### Call-to-Action (3:25-3:35)
"Go to nimbledaily.com right now. Because slowing down was never part of your plan. And the woman you'll be in 10 years? She's counting on what you do today."

## Script 2: "The Meeting That Exposed My Secret"

### Hook (0:00-0:10)
"I never thought a flight of stairs would threaten my career. But at 52, that's exactly what happened."

### The Miserable Problem (0:10-0:45)
"I'm a senior partner at a consulting firm. My job is projecting confidence, capability, strength.

Last year, big client presentation. Their office? Fifth floor. No elevator.

I walked into that conference room trying not to pant. My knees were screaming. Hands shaking—not from nerves, from five flights of stairs. My younger colleague actually asked if I needed water.

In that moment, I didn't feel like a senior partner with 25 years experience. I felt... old. Like someone who should be thinking about retirement, not landing million-dollar accounts."

### Failed Solutions (0:45-1:15)
"I tried everything.

Yoga classes where I used to be the star—now I'm modifying every pose while women half my age hold perfect planks.

Personal trainers who'd have me doing burpees that left me wrecked for a week.

Protein bars that were just Snickers with better marketing.

Collagen supplements promising to 'turn back time.' Spoiler: they didn't.

Those meal replacement shakes that left me starving an hour later and jittery from hidden caffeine.

Nothing addressed the real problem—my muscles were literally wasting away. And no amount of 'you go girl' motivation was bringing them back."

### The Climax (1:15-1:35)
"The breaking point? My performance review.

My boss—who's five years younger than me—suggested I might want to 'transition' to less travel-intensive accounts.

Translation: You're getting too old for the real work.

I've worked 25 years to sit at this table. And now they want to move me to the kiddie pool because I can't hide that a red-eye flight knocks me out for three days?"

### Unique Mechanism Introduction (1:35-2:00)
"My niece is getting her PhD in sports nutrition. She took one look at my supplement graveyard and said, 'Aunt Linda, you're taking everything except what works.'

She broke it down: After 40, women hemorrhage muscle. During menopause? It's like someone hit fast-forward on muscle loss.

She said I needed three things: Real protein—like 25+ grams. Creatine for muscle preservation. And collagen for joints.

Then she hit me with: 'You wouldn't put regular gas in a Ferrari. Why are you putting garbage in your body?'"

### Soft Guarantee (2:00-2:15)
"She pointed me to Nimble Daily. I rolled my eyes—I'd tried everything. But they have a 30-day money-back guarantee. And honestly? What did I have to lose except more muscle?"

### Why It's Better (2:15-2:45)
"This isn't just protein powder. It's 26 grams of complete protein—more than anything else out there.

But here's the kicker: It's the only one with real creatine. Clinical dose. The stuff that actually rebuilds muscle in women over 40.

Plus collagen for joints and vitamins that actually work.

Four weeks in? I stopped death-gripping handrails.

Eight weeks? I was keeping up with colleagues half my age on business trips.

I don't feel 30. I feel like a badass 52-year-old who earned every bit of her senior position."

### Social Proof (2:45-3:00)
"I told my executive women's group. Now half of them are on it. We joke we're the 'Nimble Network'—women who refuse to be sidelined.

Over 2,000 reviews saying the same thing: 'Finally, something that actually works.'"

### Authority Proof (3:00-3:15)
"Made by actual scientists and registered dietitians. Third-party tested. Every ingredient listed with exact amounts. No proprietary blend BS."

### Offer (3:15-3:25)
"20% off your first month right now. Less than your Starbucks order for something that actually changes everything."

### Call-to-Action (3:25-3:35)
"Go to nimbledaily.com. Because stairs shouldn't end careers. And age shouldn't determine your trajectory."

## Script 3: "The Grandmother Who Couldn't Keep Up"

### Hook (0:00-0:10)
"When I couldn't lift my two-year-old grandson, I knew something was very wrong. I was 48, not 80."

### The Miserable Problem (0:10-0:45)
"My daughter asked me to watch my grandson for the weekend. Should've been the best thing ever, right?

But when that sweet little boy reached up saying 'Up, Grandma!'... I couldn't do it. My back just screamed.

So I made excuses. 'Let's sit on the couch instead, sweetie.'

At the playground? Ten minutes and I was done. Meanwhile, grandmas ten years older than me were going strong.

I went home that night and just lost it. Here I am—a veterinarian who wrestles cattle for a living—and I can't pick up a toddler."

### Failed Solutions (0:45-1:15)
"I attacked this like everything else—full research mode.

Grocery store protein powders that tasted like chalk? Check.

Expensive collagen the Instagram girls love? Did nothing.

Multivitamins, calcium, joint support... My kitchen counter looked like CVS, and I still felt weak.

Even hired a nutritionist. She gave me this complicated meal plan that's impossible when you're elbow-deep in a cow at 2 AM.

And everything marketed to women my age? It's all about hot flashes and mood swings. Great. But what about being able to physically function? What about strength?"

### The Climax (1:15-1:35)
"Rock bottom happened at work.

I've been a large animal vet for 20 years. But suddenly, restraining a nervous horse left me wrecked for days. My 30-year-old assistant started automatically taking the physical cases.

I could see my future: Early retirement. Missing my grandkids growing up. Becoming one of those people who used to do things.

All because my body was giving up at 48."

### Unique Mechanism Introduction (1:35-2:00)
"At a veterinary conference, this sports medicine doctor drops this bomb: Women lose 10-15% of our muscle every decade after 30. During menopause? It speeds up.

But then she said something that got my attention: 'There's one supplement that actually rebuilds muscle in women our age. Creatine.'

I'm thinking, 'Isn't that for bodybuilders?'

She goes, 'That's the problem. It's been studied for 30 years. Completely safe. Actually works. But women won't take it because of how it's marketed.'

She said to find something that combines it with real protein and collagen. One complete formula."

### Soft Guarantee (2:00-2:15)
"That's how I found Nimble Daily. They're so confident, they'll refund you if you don't feel stronger in 30 days. After wasting money on everything else, that got my attention."

### Why It's Better (2:15-2:45)
"Here's what's different: Real doses of everything. 26 grams protein, 3 grams creatine, 10 grams collagen. Not a sprinkle for marketing—actual clinical amounts.

Made specifically for women in perimenopause and beyond. Not adapted. Not modified. Built for us.

Six weeks later? I picked up my grandson and spun him around. He giggled. I cried—happy tears this time.

Three months in? Back to all my cases at the practice.

I don't feel 30. I feel like a strong 48-year-old who can do her job and love on her grandbaby."

### Social Proof (2:45-3:00)
"I've told every woman in my rural community. The running club, the teachers, other healthcare workers.

Same story everywhere: More energy. Less pain. Actual strength coming back.

We're like this little army of women who refuse to accept that decline is inevitable."

### Authority Proof (3:00-3:15)
"Developed by real registered dietitians and PhDs. Every batch tested by third parties. Exact amounts listed—no proprietary blend nonsense."

### Offer (3:15-3:25)
"Get 20% off your first order right now. Less than a latte to start getting your strength back."

### Call-to-Action (3:25-3:35)
"Go to nimbledaily.com. Your grandkids deserve to be lifted. Your career deserves your full strength. And you deserve to feel powerful in your own body."
