# Frequently Asked Questions

## Product & Formula

### Who is this good for?
Nimble Daily is specifically formulated for women aged 38-58 who are proactive about maintaining their strength, mobility, and independence. It's ideal for:
- Women in perimenopause or post-menopause experiencing accelerated muscle loss
- Active professionals juggling demanding careers with family responsibilities
- Athletes and fitness enthusiasts seeking enhanced recovery and performance
- Women with family histories of osteoporosis or sarcopenia
- Anyone frustrated by taking multiple supplements who wants an all-in-one solution

### Who is this not good for?
Nimble Daily may not be suitable for:
- Pregnant or nursing women (consult your physician first)
- Anyone with beef or collagen allergies
- Vegans or vegetarians (our protein is beef-based)
- Those with kidney disease or requiring protein restrictions
- Anyone under 18 years of age
- Individuals seeking a meal replacement (this is a supplement, not a meal)

### How does beef protein isolate compare to other types of protein?
Beef protein isolate offers several advantages:
- **Complete amino acid profile** similar to whey but without dairy
- **97% protein concentration** with minimal fat and carbs
- **Superior bioavailability** compared to plant proteins
- **No lactose** making it ideal for those with dairy sensitivities
- **Grass-fed sourcing** ensures higher quality and ethical standards
- **Less bloating** than whey for many users
- **Better muscle protein synthesis** than collagen alone

### Why 26g of protein per serving?
Research shows women need 25-30g of protein per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis, especially after 40. Our 26g dose ensures you cross this threshold effectively while remaining easy to digest. This amount, combined with our other ingredients, optimizes muscle preservation without unnecessary calories.

### What makes your creatine dosing special?
We're the only women's protein powder with 3g of clinical-dose creatine monohydrate. This exact amount:
- Matches research protocols showing strength and cognitive benefits
- Achieves muscle saturation within 3-4 weeks
- Avoids the bloating associated with higher "loading" doses
- Is specifically calibrated for women's body composition

### Why combine protein, creatine, AND collagen?
Each ingredient targets different systems:
- **Protein**: Muscle synthesis and repair
- **Creatine**: Strength, power, and cellular energy
- **Collagen**: Joint, tendon, and connective tissue support
Together, they create comprehensive support for maintaining physical capability—something no single ingredient can achieve.

### Can I see the full list of ingredients and dosages?
Absolutely. Full transparency is core to our brand:
- Grass Fed Beef Protein Isolate: 16,000mg
- Grass Fed Collagen Peptides: 10,000mg
- Creatine Monohydrate: 3,000mg
- MCT Oil Powder: 3,000mg
- Plus essential vitamins and minerals in bioavailable forms

## Usage & Mixing

### How should I mix it?
For best results:
1. Add 1 scoop (41.82g) to 8-12 oz cold water or beverage
2. Use a shaker bottle or blender for smoothest consistency
3. Mix vigorously for 30 seconds
4. Let sit for 30 seconds to fully dissolve
5. Best consumed within 10 minutes of mixing

**Pro tips:**
- Cold liquids mix better than warm
- Adding ice can improve texture
- Can blend with unsweetened almond milk or coconut water
- Some customers add to morning coffee (once cooled slightly)

### When should I take Nimble Daily?
Timing depends on your goals:
- **For muscle synthesis**: Within 30 minutes post-workout
- **For daily convenience**: With breakfast to establish routine
- **For recovery**: Before bed (the creatine and collagen work overnight)
- **Most important**: Same time daily for consistency

### Can I take this with other supplements?
Yes, but you may not need to. Nimble Daily replaces:
- Separate protein powder
- Creatine supplement
- Collagen supplement
- Many vitamins/minerals

Continue taking:
- Omega-3s (not included)
- Vitamin D if deficient (we include 240 IU)
- Prescription medications (always consult your doctor)

### How long before I see results?
Expect this realistic timeline:
- **Week 1-2**: Improved recovery between workouts
- **Week 3-4**: Noticeable strength gains begin (creatine saturation)
- **Week 6-8**: Enhanced muscle definition and joint comfort
- **Month 3+**: Measurable improvements in strength tests and bone density markers

Remember: This is an investment, not a quick fix.

## Taste & Texture

### What does it taste like?
Let's be honest: This isn't a milkshake. It has a mild chocolate-cinnamon flavor from real cocoa and cinnamon. The taste is neutral to slightly savory. Most customers describe it as "fine" or "grows on you." We prioritize efficacy over flavor—no added sugars or artificial sweeteners that compromise the formula.

### Why doesn't it taste sweeter?
We refuse to add:
- Sugar (accelerates aging and inflammation)
- Artificial sweeteners (can disrupt gut health)
- "Natural flavors" (often hide processing agents)
- Stevia in large amounts (can have aftertaste)

We use minimal monk fruit for subtle sweetness without compromising the formula's integrity.

### Can I add flavoring to improve taste?
Absolutely! Popular additions:
- Half a banana (adds creaminess and natural sweetness)
- Handful of berries (antioxidants plus flavor)
- Teaspoon of vanilla extract
- Dash of cinnamon or nutmeg
- Blend with ice and unsweetened cocoa

### Is the texture gritty?
Our beef protein isolate and collagen are instantized for smooth mixing. Some users notice slight texture initially, but proper mixing (shaker bottle or blender) creates a smooth consistency. The texture is similar to other premium protein powders.

## Science & Research

### Is creatine safe for women?
Absolutely. Creatine is one of the most studied supplements with 30+ years of research. For women specifically:
- Improves strength without "bulking"
- Supports bone density
- May improve mood and cognitive function
- Especially beneficial during hormonal transitions
- No negative effects on kidneys in healthy individuals

### Will creatine make me gain weight?
You may see 1-2 lbs of initial water weight as muscles become hydrated and volumized. This is:
- Intramuscular water (inside muscles), not bloating
- A sign creatine is working
- Associated with strength gains
- Different from fat gain
- Beneficial for muscle function

### What research supports your formula?
Our formula is based on extensive research including:
- NIH studies on muscle loss in aging women
- Clinical trials on creatine for perimenopausal women
- Research on collagen for joint health
- Studies on protein timing and muscle synthesis
- Data on micronutrient deficiencies in active women

All ingredients meet or exceed doses used in successful clinical trials.

### Why beef protein instead of whey or plant protein?
Research and real-world experience show:
- **Better than whey**: No dairy-related bloating or inflammation
- **Better than plant**: Complete amino acids without combining sources
- **Absorption rate**: Similar to whey (fast) but easier on digestion
- **Sustainability**: Grass-fed sourcing supports regenerative agriculture
- **Effectiveness**: Equal or superior muscle protein synthesis

- Slight water retention from creatine (beneficial)
- Increased thirst (stay hydrated)

If you experience any concerning symptoms, discontinue use and consult your physician.

### Is this safe during perimenopause/menopause?
Yes, and particularly beneficial. During hormonal transitions:
- Muscle loss accelerates (up to 10% per decade)
- Bone density decreases rapidly
- Recovery slows
- Energy decreases

Our formula specifically addresses these changes with targeted nutrition.

### Can I take this if I have a medical condition?
Consult your physician before starting any supplement if you have:

Our formula is generally safe but medical conditions require professional guidance.

### Is this FDA approved?
Like all supplements, Nimble Daily is not FDA approved (the FDA doesn't approve supplements). However:
- Manufactured in FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities
- Third-party tested for purity and potency
- Exceeds industry standards for quality
- All ingredients are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)

### Is this safe for long-term use?
Yes. Our formula contains:
- No proprietary blends hiding doses
- No stimulants requiring cycling
- Only researched, safe ingredients
- Nutrients your body needs daily

This is designed for lifelong use as part of your health maintenance routine.

## Special Considerations

### I'm an athlete. Will this help my performance?
Absolutely. Athletes using Nimble Daily report:
- Faster recovery between training sessions
- Improved power output (from creatine)
- Better joint resilience during high-impact activities
- Sustained energy without stimulants
- Enhanced muscle preservation during intense training

Many competitive athletes use this as their foundation supplement.

### I'm not very active. Will this still help?
Yes, perhaps even more so. Sedentary individuals lose muscle faster. Nimble Daily helps:
- Preserve existing muscle mass
- Support bone density
- Maintain metabolic health
- Improve energy levels
- Protect joint health

You don't need to be an athlete to benefit from foundational nutrition.

### Can men take this product?
While formulated for women's specific needs, men can safely use Nimble Daily. However:
- Men may need additional protein (their threshold is often 30-40g)
- The micronutrient profile is optimized for women
- Men might prefer our upcoming men's formula (in development)

### I'm trying to lose weight. Will this help or hinder?
Nimble Daily supports healthy weight loss by:
- Preserving lean muscle during caloric deficit
- Improving metabolic rate
- Reducing muscle loss that slows metabolism
- Providing satiety with minimal calories (161 per serving)
- Supporting energy for workouts

This isn't a weight loss product, but it protects what matters during weight loss: your muscle.

### I have trouble with supplements. Any tips?
Start slowly:
1. Begin with half a scoop for 3-4 days
2. Gradually increase to full scoop
3. Take with food initially if needed
4. Ensure adequate water intake (64+ oz daily)
5. Consider digestive enzymes if needed

Most adjustment issues resolve within a week.
