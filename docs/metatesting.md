## Budget Allocation & Campaign Structure ($8,000/Month)

### Critical Context: Learning Phase & CAC Reality Check

**Meta Learning Phase Requirements:**
- Need **50 conversions per week** at the ad set level to exit learning phase
- At $80-100 CAC, that's $4,000-5,000/week per ad set
- **Reality:** With $8,000/month budget, we won't exit learning phase initially
- **Strategy:** Focus on learning, not optimization. Accept higher CACs during testing.

**Initial CAC Assumptions:**
- Product price: $65-85
- Target CAC long-term: <$40
- Expected initial CAC: $80-100 (realistic for new brand)
- Break-even ROAS: ~1.0x initially, improving over time

---

### Revised Testing Approach: Sequential Learning Strategy

Since we can't achieve 50 conversions/week with this budget, we'll optimize for maximum learning per dollar spent.

### Weeks 1-2: Combined Message & Creative Testing ($4,000)
**Campaign:** Foundation Testing
**Budget:** $285/day × 14 days = $4,000
**Expected Conversions:** ~40-50 total at $80-100 CAC

**Campaign Structure:**
- **1 Campaign:** "Nimble_Foundation_Jan25" (CBO enabled)
- **3 Ad Sets:** Top 3 value props only
  - Support Your GLP-1 Journey (GLP-1 users)
  - Maintain Your Edge
  - Protect Your Future
- **Budget per ad set:** ~$95/day
- **9 Ads Total:** 3 creatives × 3 messages
  - Test visual styles simultaneously with messages
  - Professional woman vs athletic woman vs product focus
  
**Why This Works:** Concentrating budget into fewer ad sets increases daily spend per ad set, getting closer to learning thresholds and generating more meaningful data.

### Week 3: Audience Expansion Testing ($2,000)
**Campaign:** Audience Testing
**Budget:** $285/day × 7 days = $2,000
**Expected Conversions:** ~20-25 total

**Campaign Structure:**
- **1 Campaign:** "Nimble_Audience_Jan25" (CBO)
- **2 Ad Sets Only:** (to concentrate spend)
  - **Narrow:** Women 42-52 + perimenopause/menopause interests + high income
  - **Broad:** Women 38-58, Advantage+ audience expansion ON
- **2 Ads Total:** Winning creative/message combo from weeks 1-2

**Key Decision:** Are we better off with precise targeting or letting Meta find buyers?

### Week 4: Landing Page & Offer Testing ($2,000)
**Campaign:** Conversion Testing
**Budget:** $285/day × 7 days = $2,000
**Expected Conversions:** ~20-25 total

**Campaign Structure:**
- **1 Campaign:** "Nimble_Conversion_Jan25" (CBO)
- **2 Ad Sets:** Best audience from Week 3
  - Landing Page A: Problem-focused with 15% first-time discount
  - Landing Page B: Authority-focused with free shipping over $100
- **2 Ads Total:** Best performer only

**Purpose:** Test both landing page narrative AND pricing/offer strategy

## Adjusted Testing Best Practices for Limited Budget

### Learning Phase Reality:
- **Accept you'll stay in learning phase initially** - that's OK for testing
- **Focus on directional learnings** rather than perfect optimization
- **Consolidate budget** into fewer ad sets for meaningful data
- **Use Advantage+ features** to help Meta optimize with limited data

### Budget Rules for $8K/Month:
- **Minimum $50/day per ad set** (better to have 2 ad sets at $140/day than 4 at $70)
- **Run tests for full 7 days** before major decisions (more time needed with fewer conversions)
- **Reserve 25% budget** ($2,000) for scaling any early winners

### Revised Success Metrics:
- **Week 1-2:** Focus on CPM, CTR, Add to Cart rate (upper funnel metrics)
- **Week 3:** Add to Cart → Purchase conversion rate
- **Week 4:** Actual CAC and ROAS (now you have enough data)
- **Acceptable initial CAC:** $80-120 (it will decrease as you optimize)

### Alternative Strategy if CACs are Too High:
Consider a **subscription launch offer** to improve initial conversion:
- First month 20% off
- Subscribe & save 15% ongoing
- This improves LTV:CAC ratio immediately

### Creative Production Tips:
- Batch shoot all visual variations in one session
- Use native aspect ratios: 9:16 (Stories/Reels), 1:1 (Feed), 4:5 (Feed)
- Keep videos under 15 seconds for initial tests
- Always include captions/text overlay

### Audience Settings:
- **Age:** 38-58 (core: 42-52)
- **Gender:** Women only
- **Location:** United States (exclude Alaska/Hawaii initially for shipping costs)
- **Language:** English
- **Detailed Expansion:** OFF (maintain control during testing)
- **Advantage Campaign Budget:** ON for Weeks 2-4
- **Attribution:** 7-day click, 1-day view
