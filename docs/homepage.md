## [OBJECTION HANDLING FAQ]

**HEADLINE:**
Let's Address the Elephant in the Room

**"Isn't creatine for bodybuilders?"**
No. Creatine is the most studied supplement after protein, with specific benefits for women including improved bone density, cognitive function, and muscle maintenance—without any "bulking."

**"How does it taste?"**
Like cinnamon cocoa—not overly sweet. This isn't a milkshake; it's functional nutrition that happens to taste good. Mix with water, milk alternative, or blend in your smoothie.

**"Will I see results at my age?"**
Especially at your age. The research shows women 40+ have the most to gain from targeted protein and creatine supplementation. Your body's needs have changed—your nutrition should too.

**"What if it doesn't work for me?"**
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. But more importantly, every ingredient is backed by peer-reviewed research at clinical doses. This isn't hope in a bottle—it's science.

## [FOUNDER'S NOTE SECTION]

**HEADLINE:**
A Note from Our Founder

**(Image: Professional photo of female founder, age 48)**

*"I created Nimble after watching my mother lose her independence to preventable muscle and bone loss. Despite being a successful executive, she hadn't been given the tools to maintain her physical strength.*

*At 45, I realized I was on the same path—strong career, declining body. The supplement industry offered me either bodybuilding products or anti-aging fairy dust. Neither respected my intelligence or addressed my actual needs.*

*Nimble is different because it's built on evidence, not hope. It's for women who lead, who refuse to slow down, and who understand that strength is an investment, not vanity."*

— **Katherine Chen**, Founder & CEO
