## Core Ingredients & Research

### ðŸ§¬ Creatine Monohydrate (3g)
**The Most Studied Supplement After Protein**

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Muscle & Strength:** Women supplementing with creatine showed 10-15% greater increases in strength compared to training alone ([Kreider et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/))
- **Bone Health:** Postmenopausal women taking creatine + resistance training increased bone mineral density more than exercise alone ([Chilibeck et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386713/))
- **Cognitive Benefits:** Creatine supplementation improved memory and reduced mental fatigue in women ([Avgerinos et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/))

**Why 3g?** This is the research-validated maintenance dose shown to saturate muscle creatine stores with consistent daily use.

### ðŸ¥© Grass-Fed Beef Protein Isolate (16g)
**Complete Amino Acid Profile for Muscle Maintenance**

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Muscle Protein Synthesis:** Beef protein equally effective as whey for supporting muscle growth and recovery ([Valenzuela et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268137/))
- **Leucine Content:** Contains 2.5g leucine per servingâ€”the threshold for maximizing muscle protein synthesis in adults over 40
- **Iron & B12:** Naturally occurring heme iron and B12 support energy metabolism, crucial for active women

### ðŸ¦´ Collagen Peptides Type I & III (10g)
**Joint, Tendon & Connective Tissue Support**

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Joint Health:** 10g daily collagen reduced activity-related joint pain by 43% in athletes over 24 weeks ([Clark et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18416885/))
- **Tendon Strength:** Collagen supplementation increased tendon cross-sectional area and strength in conjunction with exercise ([Oertzen-Hagemann et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345262/))
- **Skin Health:** Type I collagen improved skin elasticity and hydration in women aged 35-55 ([Proksch et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949208/))

### ðŸ’Š Key Micronutrients

#### Vitamin D3 (240 IU)
- **Muscle Function:** Vitamin D deficiency associated with 2x higher risk of muscle weakness in women ([Visser et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12730414/))
- **Bone Density:** Combined with calcium, reduces fracture risk by 15-30% in postmenopausal women

#### Magnesium Bisglycinate (90mg)
- **Muscle Recovery:** Magnesium supplementation reduced muscle soreness and improved recovery time ([CÃ³rdova et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31330865/))
- **Sleep Quality:** Improved sleep efficiency and reduced cortisol in older adults

#### Vitamin K2-MK7 (72mcg)
- **Bone Health:** 3-year study showed K2 supplementation improved bone strength and reduced fracture risk in postmenopausal women ([Knapen et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23525894/))

## The Perimenopause & Menopause Connection

### Why These Ingredients Matter More After 40

**The Challenge:**
- Women lose 3-8% of muscle mass per decade after 30
- This accelerates to 10-15% during menopause transition
- Bone density drops 1-2% yearly after menopause
- Recovery time increases 40-50% compared to younger years

**The Solution:**
Our formula specifically addresses these changes:

1. **Creatine** becomes even more critical as natural production declines with age
2. **Protein needs increase** from 0.8g/kg to 1.2-1.5g/kg body weight
3. **Collagen production drops 1% yearly** after age 20, accelerating at menopause
4. **Micronutrient absorption decreases**, requiring more bioavailable forms

## Research Quality Standards

### What Makes Our Research Selection Different

âœ… **Peer-Reviewed Studies Only** - Published in respected scientific journals

âœ… **Human Studies Prioritized** - Not just cell or animal research

âœ… **Gender-Specific When Available** - Studies on women, not just extrapolated from men

âœ… **Clinically Relevant Doses** - We match the amounts used in successful studies

âœ… **Recent Research** - Prioritizing studies from the last 10 years

## Bioavailability & Absorption

### Why Form Matters

**Chelated Minerals:** We use bisglycinate forms of magnesium and zinc for 2-4x better absorption than oxide forms

**Methylated B-Vitamins:** Using P5P (B6) and methylcobalamin (B12) - the active forms your body can use immediately

**MCT Oil Inclusion:** Enhances fat-soluble vitamin absorption (D3, K2, E) by up to 50%

**No Competing Nutrients:** Carefully balanced to avoid absorption interference

## Safety & Testing

### Third-Party Verification

Every batch of Nimble Daily undergoes:
- Heavy metal testing (lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic)
- Microbiological testing (salmonella, E. coli, yeast, mold)
- Protein quality verification (amino acid profile)
- Label claim verification (actual vs stated amounts)

## Frequently Asked Research Questions

### "Is creatine safe for women?"
**Absolutely.** The International Society of Sports Nutrition's 2021 position stand specifically addresses and debunks myths about creatine in women. No water retention, no "bulking"â€”just improved strength and recovery.

### "Why beef protein instead of whey?"
Beef protein is dairy-free, less likely to cause bloating, and provides additional nutrients like iron and B12 that many women are deficient in. Research shows it's equally effective for muscle protein synthesis.

### "Do I really need this much protein?"
Research shows women over 40 need 1.2-1.5g protein per kg body weight to maintain muscle. For a 150lb woman, that's 82-102g daily. Nimble provides 26g of high-quality protein to help reach that target.

### "What about soy for menopause?"
While soy has benefits, our formula focuses on strength and structural support rather than hormonal intervention. This makes it suitable for all women, regardless of hormone therapy choices.
